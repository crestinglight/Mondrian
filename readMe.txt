This Mondrian project requires Sinatra to run.
In order to start your local server, run "ruby webControl.rb" in the command line from inside the "/Mondrian" folder. This will begin running the server.
Go to your prefered browser, and in the URL, type "localhost:4567". This will open the Mondrian page.
When you're done messing around with the Mondrian, press "Save" in the lower left-hand corner, and it will save a CSV of your corresponding colors.
